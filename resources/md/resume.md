# Education
M. Sc., Mathematics, 2010; B.A., Mathematics, 2007, Portland State University

# Work Experience

## 8th Light, Apprentice, July - November 2017
* Delivered projects using test-driven development in Java (JUnit) and Ruby (rspec), writing my own mocks and running new code through Travis-CI to protect the master branch from regressions
* Wrote a multi-threaded http server in Java from the socket layer up, tested to serve images and text for up to 2000 concurrent connections, deployed to Amazon EC2
* Served as a math expert on the data science & engineering strategy working group
* Learned to work in the XP style: PERT story point estimation, TDD, pair programming, weekly iterations

## Peloton, Apprentice Developer, April - September 2016
* Wrote unit tests supporting a complete architectural overhaul (from SOAP to REST) of backend services for Nordstrom (Node.js, Immutable.js, RxJS, Chai)
* Built and tested fullstack web service for medical accessioning and pathologist reports (Node.js, React, RethinkDB, Jest)
* Researched several closed source bot platforms and TensorFlow’s SyntaxNet to assess their potential for natural language processing and conversational interfaces
* Agile development with Slack and Trello: kanban, frequent pair programming, developing user stories with a customer representative, breaking user stories into developer tasks
* Version control and continuous development with Git, Docker, and Drone
* During off hours, continued experimenting with Clojure and ClojureScript for bookmarking and publishing interfaces, learning about clojure.spec, Figwheel, Reagent, Rum, and Material UI in the process (e.g., a service to render Pinboard.in bookmarks with a custom interface: https://github.com/mathpunk/anansi)

## Xipiter, Data Scientist (Contract), June - September 2015
* Assessed and reported on the benefits and limitations of various machine learning algorithms for the “Senrio” IoT security product
* Developed a plan for sampling, visualizing, and cross-validating of a support vector machine to classify packets
* Prototyped a machine learning pipeline in Python (scikit-learn, pandas, support vector machines)
 
## Independent Research, Writing, and Speaking, August 2010 - March 2016
* Wrote first two drafts of my book, Punk Mathematics, after being contacted by the literary agency Science Factory; third draft in progress
* Continued research in category theory, algebra, and topology for data analysis, functional programming, and distributed computing
* Gave speeches at various conferences and events across the United States, including TEDxMountHood, CyborgCamp and Weird Shift
* Collaborated over the web with mathematicians, engineers, artists, and social scientists on topics in data, computation, and its effects on society
* Wrote a number of small experiments on problems in text mining and knowledge management in Clojure (e.g., migrated an Evernote export into MongoDB https://github.com/mathpunk/evermunge)

## Portland State University, Teacher, September 2006 - June 2010
* Developed and taught undergraduate courses in algebra, trigonometry, and calculus
* Taught a “math for liberal arts majors” course, to expose math-averse students to a wide variety of math applications (voting theory, fair division, graph theory, and others)
* Taught discrete mathematics to graduate students 
* Elected by peers to represent student viewpoints in PSU Math Department Promotion & Tenure Committee

## CitySearch.com, Proofreader, August 1999 - February 2001
* Checked typists’ work for errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and formatting
* Verified content against customer-submitted information packets
* Worked with management to develop a double-verification scheme to develop trust and mutual respect between the typing pool and the proofreading department
