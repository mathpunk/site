I apprenticed with [8th Light](http://8thlight.com) from July to November 2017. 8th Light is a consultancy with offices in four cities, and has a strong commitment to principles of clean code, simple design, and craft. While there I learned about agile development, using [story point estimation](https://8thlight.com/blog/bjorn-johnson/2016/11/29/making-large-projects-manageable.html) and [test-driven development](https://8thlight.com/blog/chris-jordan/2016/04/13/happiness-and-tdd.html) to incrementally [design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html) simple, easy-to-change code in response to the needs of my "customers" (the software developers who mentored me.)

Three hundred people apply to be apprentices at 8th Light each month. To get into the program, I submitted a [tic-tac-toe game in Clojure](http://github.com/mathpunk/ttt), and the projects I worked on while there included a second [tic-tac-toe program in Ruby](http://github.com/mathpunk/ttt-ruby) and an [http server in Java](http://github.com/mathpunk/httpserver), written from sockets up. I also kept a [blog](http://blog.chiral.computer/categories/8L/index.html) of my observations and questions. My github profile is [here](http://github.com/mathpunk).
