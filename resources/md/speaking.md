I have a knack for mixing mind-bendy mathematical philosophy with humor and a human perspective. I've taught math-averse liberal arts majors, as well as grad students in mathematics. As an improv comedian with Portland's Light-Fingered Five, I made stuff up in front of an audience of thousands at the Bite of Oregon festival, and an audience of one, when a single person showed up to see our improvised version of "Dracula" at a remote community college theater. 

Talks I've given include:

-   ["2 Plus 2 Equals Fear"](http://youtube.talks), TEDx Mount Hood, 2015
-   "Hypergraphs for Understanding Weaponized Social Media", Weaponized Social, 2014
-   "Strategic Disbelief," magick.codes, 2013
-   "Time, Space, and The Self Are Illusions &#x2014; So Do 'You' Want To Go 'Out' With 'Me' 'Tonight'?", Esozone, 2013
-   "Life's a Parameterized Hilbert Space and Then You Converge To The Null Vector", Weird Shift Con, 2012

I can arrive on-site with no predetermined plan and discover what we want to talk about, together. I'm equally ready to prepare extensively and speak for as long as an audience cares to stick around. Topics I'm especially ready to discuss these days are:

-   machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data: the math, the technology, and the ethics
-   information retrieval and filtering when attention is scarce
-   graph theory for sociologists
-   social problems in an age of big data, artificial intelligence, and social networks

&#x2026;but, to be quite honest, I can find a mathematical angle on pretty much any topic you can think of. If you've got an idea, write to me at [tom (at) mathpunk.net](mailto:tom@mathpunk.net).
